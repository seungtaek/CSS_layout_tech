<p>I am content inside of a section. I want this section (which has a green background) to stretch to the full height of the layout. I could set height to 100%, but that by itself doesn't have the desired result. To make the element truly stretch to the full height, I have to also explicitly set the height of all its parent elements as well.</p>
